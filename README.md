# Spring-news-hub-API

## Description 

The Spring News Hub API is a Java web application designed for tech news enthusiasts, built with Spring Boot and leveraging PostgreSQL for data management. It utilizes Spring Data JPA for database access, Spring Web for RESTful services, Spring Session for session management, and Thymeleaf for dynamic front-end rendering. Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their posts by submitting titles and URLs, allowing others to upvote and comment on submissions. Although the project is basic, it serves as a valuable tool for understanding Spring APIs and their functionalities.

## Instalation

To set up the application, clone the repository, ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running, configure the application properties for the database connection, and then build and run the application using Maven.

## Usage

To use this application, create an account and make a post in the "Create Post" section of the dashboard. You can edit or delete your posts in the post list on the dashboard and view all posts on the homepage by clicking the "Spring News" button. Users can leave upvotes or comments on different posts by clicking the comments link to the right of each post.
